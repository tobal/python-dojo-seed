# python-dojo-seed

This is a repository to use as a seed for python projects or dojos.

## Bootstrapping the environment

We use pipenv to encapsulate the environment, use the `bootstrap` maketarget to
initialize the virtual env.

```
$> make bootstrap
```

## Running tests

You can run your tests using the `check` maketarget:

```
$> make check
```
